Heart disease prediction
The World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths in
All over the world, every year due to heart disease. Half
Deaths in the United States and other developed countries due to
Cardiovascular disease. Early warning can help
For cardiovascular disease to make decisions about
Lifestyle changes in at-risk patients
Reduce complications. This research aims to identify the most important factors
Risk related to heart disease as well as prediction of overall risk
using logistic regression.

The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website, and is from an ongoing study of cardiology
and blood vessels on the residents of Framingham, Massachusetts.
The objective of classification is to predict whether a patient is susceptible
10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
or not. The dataset provides patient information. includes more
From 4000 records and 15 attributes.
Each trait is a potential risk factor. There are risk factors
Demographic, behavioral and medical.
• sex: male or female
• Age: the age of the patient
• Current smoker: whether the patient is a current smoker
Cigs Per Day: The number of cigarettes a person smokes in
average in one day
BP Meds: Whether or not the patient is taking blood pressure medications
no
• Diffuse stroke: whether the patient has had a stroke
Previous stroke
• Common high: whether the patient has high pressure
the blood
• Diabetes: whether the patient has diabetes
• Tot Chol: Total cholesterol level
• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure
• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure
• Heart rate: heart rate
• Gel and Cos: glucose level
Target :
Predicting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) by 10 years 
Results:
• Regarding gender, we found that males are more likely to be infected than females
• The age coefficient shows that there is an increase in cases of infection when
certain ages
• With each additional cigarette one smokes, the risk of infection increases
• For glucose level, there is no significant change.
